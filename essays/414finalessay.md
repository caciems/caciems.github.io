## My Reflection

Before the semester started, I had no expectations of what this class was going to be like except that it’s a continuation of 314. Then, we were told that we were tasked with converting the HAAC HUI website from Semantic UI to Bootstrap. I thought this was going to a pretty simple task. All we have to do is look for the equivalent of the Semantic UI component in the Bootstrap documentation and change the code for it. I found out the hard way that it this was not the case at all. I found out that Bootstrap works completely differently from Semantuic UI and that sometimes we need to import other functions in order to make it work with other components of the page. For example, in Semantic UI there’s already a component included in the Semantic UI package for icons. However, in Bootstrap, we needed to import a new package if we wanted to use icons on the page. I also had to find documentation for what the icons would look like because some of them either wasn’t included in the Bootstrap Icons list or was given a different name. On top of that, we were tasked with switching from using withTracker to useTracker, which required me to google more about useTracker so that I could implement it on the pages I worked on. There was a time where I was stuck converting a page for hours because the page kept crashing because I couldn’t figure out how to implement useTracker with the code. One main lesson that I learned from this class is that it requires a lot of googling and researching about functions and components and how to use them. This class gave me insight about what it might be like to pursue a career in software engineering and web development.
