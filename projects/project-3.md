In my senior year of high school, I was selected to be the attendance keeper for the marching band. I was responsible for taking attendance for all the members in the marching band at practices, football games, and marching band competitions, and keeping an organized record of the attendance for the entire season. I was also responsible for keeping tabs on every single person riding on a certain bus when the band has to go off campus for football games or competitions. This includes any band directors, techs, and chaperones that decide to come with us on these trips. Sometimes the adults were harder to keep tabs on than the students.

In addition to attendance, I was also a secondary section leader if the main section leader was absent for other activities. Since the primary section leader took care of the music, I would mainly cover marching technique and formation placement on the field. During marching sectionals, I would correct any incorrect marching techniques so that the individual is more comfortable while marching and won't stand out from the rest of the band. The same applies to correcting formations on the field. Me and other leadership would ask people to move so that the general shape of the formation doesn't look awkward from the audience point of view. The leadership team would also meet with the band directors and techs (musicians outside of the school who would come help the band) to give suggestions in the music and/or visuals to add in the show to increase our score in marching band competitions.
