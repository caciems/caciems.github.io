In my senior year of high school, I was selected to be the attendance keeper for the marching band. I ran around campus to the different sections to take attendance. Not only do I have to take attendance of the students, I had to take attendance for the chaperones that came with us to band competitions. Certain chaperones were assigned to the bus I was on, and surprisingly enough the adults were harder to keep tabs on than the students. I was also responsible for relaying information between students, section leaders, and the band directors. I collected any doctor's notes or notes of absence from students to give to the band directors. Being the attendance keeper forced me to learn about organization and communication.
