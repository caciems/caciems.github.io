The Momilani Family Fun Fair is an annual event at Momilani Elementary School for their students to enjoy after an entire school year. Since Pearl City High School is right next door, students in the band program would go and help run the various games and food stands set up all over the cafeteria area. Since I was assigned to run the games, we were tasked to help the students win the game without making it obvious, which was easier said than done... Running the games quickly got stressful as the kids would run towards the games to fill out their stamp cards. There will always be a long line of rowdy and loud kids wanting to give a try at the game. Even if they donâ€™t win, we still give them a stamp on their stamp card. The kids go to the various games and win for a stamp on their stamp card. Filling out this stamp card gives them the chance to win the jackpot prize consisting of toys or a V-Bucks card for Fortnite.
