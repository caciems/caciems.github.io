In my junior year of high school, I was selected to become an academy ambassador for the Academy of Technology and Design. I was responsible for presenting information about the school’s academy program to prospective students and staff from other schools and the government. Our school invited people that worked directly with Governor Ige and staff members from the elementary schools in our district to our campus to display the culinary program. Me and the other ambassadors were tasked to strike up a conversation with the higher ups to learn about what they’re doing to incorporate student participation at Waikiki restaurants, elementary schools, and more to build experience within their pathway.
